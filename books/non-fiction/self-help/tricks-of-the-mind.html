                <h3 class="book-author">by Derren Brown</h3>

                <p class="book-description">
                    <br>
                    The definitive book by Britain's favourite illusionist... Derren Brown's television and stage
                    performances have entranced and dumbfounded millions. His baffling illusions and stunning set pieces
                    - such as The Séance, Russian Roulette and The Heist - have set new standards of what's possible, as
                    well as causing more than their fair share of controversy. Now, for the first time, he reveals the
                    secrets behind his craft, what makes him tick and just why he grew that beard. Tricks of the Mind
                    takes you on a journey into the structure and psychology of magic. Derren also takes a long hard
                    look at the paranormal industry, and looks at why some of us feel the need to believe in it in the
                    first place. Alternately hilarious, controversial and challenging, Tricks of the Mind is essential
                    reading for Derren's legions of fans, and pretty bloody irresistible even for those who don't like
                    him that much... Derren was born in 1971 in Croydon. It was a difficult birth - his mother was in
                    Devon at the time. A precocious and puzzling only child, he liked to paint, foster obsessive habits
                    and once set fire to a neighbour's boat by accident. Derren went on to study Law and German at
                    Bristol University and fell in love with the city. This was a time when marriage between man and
                    city was still frowned upon, so rather than face public derision Derren decided just to live there
                    forever instead. During this time he began to perform magic in bars and restaurants, and gave
                    occasional hypnosis shows. Then in 1999 he was asked by Channel 4 to put a mind-reading programme
                    together for television, which became Derren Brown: Mind Control. Mind Controls 2 and 3 followed and
                    then, in October 2003, Derren caused an international furore by playing Russian Roulette live on
                    television. This secured his notoriety with the public and a big apartment in London. Further
                    specials have followed - Derren Brown: The Seance was the most complained about show in the history
                    of television. He still receives several letters of complaint a week from psychics and Christians.
                    He is sensitive to everyone's objections but knows at least the latter group will forgive him.
                    Derren lives in London with a large collection of taxidermy and a fatalistic parrot.
